Give your VSCode a treat, install **Velvet Mango** - embrace the caress of deep _velvety_ purples; let your editor become enveloped by warm _scrumptious_ oranges.
It's not a desert, it does however give you some eye candy as you _tip-tap-clap_ your _groovy_ code.

_Font is Fira Code, yum._

## Language support

The theme has primarily been tested with:

-   JavaScript
-   TypeScript

in the repo, screenshots are super helpful for knowing what's in need of changing.
